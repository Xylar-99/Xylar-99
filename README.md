## ðŸš€ About Me

**Backend Developer** | **1337 (42 Network) Student** | **Morocco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦**

I'm a passionate backend developer studying at **1337 School**, part of the prestigious **42 Network**. I specialize in building robust server-side applications and system programming with a focus on clean, efficient code.
# Snake Game

Simple, self-contained Snake game implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository now contains a small Snake game you can run locally in a browser. It is intentionally lightweight and dependency-free.

Files added:

- `index.html` â€” game UI and controls
- `style.css` â€” minimal styling and responsive layout
- `script.js` â€” game logic (input, movement, collision, scoring)

## How to run

1) Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or serve via a local static server).

2) Controls:
- Arrow keys or WASD to move the snake
- Press Space to pause/resume

3) Play and enjoy!

## Want to serve it locally with a tiny HTTP server

If you have Python installed, run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Notes

- The game is intentionally compact and easy to extend.
- If you want additional features (mobile touch controls, levels, high score persistence), tell me and I'll add them.
